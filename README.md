Calculated a sine wave using given amp,freq and sample rate. The wave was translated to an array of 16bit values in order to play inside sine.wav . Using the same array, I modified the values to fit within max and min values of the amplitude to simulate a fuzz effect. 
I ended up using simpleaudio instead of pyaudio as I was having troubles inititally getting pyaudio dependencies correct as well as pip being finicky in VScode. I most likely will run in a linux enviorment next time. I also struggling with the method to use when clipping the wave. I initially tried to retrieve a wav object from the .wav file in order to iterate through the array but this was incorrect as I just needed to modify the array before sending the values to the clipped.wav. Futhermore, no iteration is needed when I modify the wave using numpy array method 
.clip, which changes values as needed to fit a min and max. It would be interesting to tinker with the current waves now and try to make a more distinct distortion. I have a hard time hearing the different in the two files, but the wave forms are correct.
